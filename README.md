# 3900-Activity2

This Activity 2 folder contains all of the files used to compose an HTML/CSS website utilizing bootstrap.

The website is a basic HTML/CSS page for the Web Application Development course 3900. This is a page that
briefly describes my experience in the field of education and work experience. I have ensured that there
have been more than one image inserted onto the web page. There are 4 different tabs that are available
for users to access including Home, About, Projects, and Work. There are currently 2 active pages that provide
content to the user, meeting the requirement specified in the activity requirement for there being 2 active
pages.

The website also contains a hamburger icon that is present when accessed via a mobile device. This will allow
for a greater user experience when accessing the site from other devices other than a laptop or desktop computer.

There are multiple links that have been added into the various buttons and links that are provided throughout the
site. There have been sites linked such as my personal Linkedin page, the github repository, and the UNO home
page.
